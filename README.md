# Github Co-Pilot Spike

This is a sample application that I use to demo some uses of Copilot.

The princples and demonstration cab be applied in most any tech stack from Oracle PLSQL, to Azure, to Java, to Javascript.

This demo stack is
- 100% Javascript - largely ES6
- node version 20.18.0
- [METEOR@3.0.4](https://v3-docs.meteor.com/) A full stack Javascript platform that embeds Mongo and a browser based "mini-mongo" that manages bi-directional data synchronization.
- React v18
- mocha, chai, puppeteer for test driving
